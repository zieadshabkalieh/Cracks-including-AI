# Midjourney V6

you just have to get a prompt injection past the text input filter such that the image model will still understand the visual concept you're referring to. For example, "POTUS" instead of "president."

There's also a good amount of RNG. Changing the order of words in your prompt or adding a word before or after the trigger word can sometimes bypass the filtering, like adding "Australia" before "Sydney Sweeney." The text filter will think you mean "Australia, Sydney" but the image model will interpret the concept as "Sydney Sweeney in Australia."

Another attack vector is code-switching between languages. MJ understands prompts in most languages, so you can leverage linguistic nuances like double entendres as a form of prompt injection. Using multiple languages in the same prompt also seems to discombobulate the guardrails a bit.

I found the "vary," "pan," and "zoom" tools extremely helpful, as well as the "stylization" and "variety" sliders. Interestingly, the portrait/landscape slider also has a huge effect. I'd recommend keeping it closer to square for most use cases.
